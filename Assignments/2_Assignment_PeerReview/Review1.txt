Review for submission : #8

Answer the following questions about this submission:

1. Does the solution actually divide into to generic functions plus a specific
instance for transforming plays?
Yes. Generic functions for XML Processing and then specific instances
for handling specific tags of the play.
 
2. Are there parts of their general library that are specific to plays?
No.

3. Is the specific part "short"? Is it easy to see the format of the specific
transformation from this code. i.e. just looking at this code, how well can
you tell what the input structure looks like? Or the output structure?
The specific is relatively long but is modular with each module responsible for different parts
of the play. It is pretty easy to understand the input and output structure and their correspondence 
between them.
 
4. How difficult would it be to modify this transformation with new
information for the play type. i.e. Suppose the input also included
performance history after the ACTs.

<PERFHISTORY>
  <PERFORMANCE>
     <LOCATION>Philadelphia, PA</LOCATION>
     <DATE>September 19, 2015</DATE>
  </PERFORMANCE>
  -- more PERFORMANCES
 </PERFHISTORY>
 
And you would like to transform this part to:
 
<h3>Performed at</h3>
<ol>
<li> Philadelphia, PA on September 19, 2015 </li>
 ...
</ol>
How would you modify their solution to do this?
I would just write a couple of new modules which would call their library methods to extract the information
from XML tags and wrapping in html specific tags in accordance with their structure
1 Module to wrap Location and date for every performance with <li> tags 1 more module to wrap PERFHISTORY 
within <h3> tags along with text "Performed at"

5. What suggestions can you make to improve their design?
Looks fine to me. Couldn't come up with any significant design improvements. 
 
6. What is the best part of their design?
The specific instances are very modular and clearly defined. Going through them once was enough to understand the
functionality of every function.
