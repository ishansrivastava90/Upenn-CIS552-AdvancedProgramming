User-defined datatypes
======================

So far, we've mostly talked about how to use the types that appear in
the Haskell standard library.  We also discussed a few type synonyms,
like

     type XY = (Double,Double)

from the last lecture, but we haven't described any ways to define
really _new_ types.

As a motivating example, suppose you are writing an application that
deals with calendars, and you need to represent the days of the week.
You might be tempted to `String` or `Int`, but both of these choices
have downsides.  If you use

  type Day = String

there will be lots of `Day`s that don't actually represent real days.
Also, you will need to devise and adhere to some sort of
standardization - is Monday represented by "Monday", "monday",
"MONDAY", or "Mon"?  Should you handle more than one of these?

The choice

  type Day = Int

has similar problems.  There are lots of Ints that won't represent
valid days.  And you'll have to remember whether you pick Sunday or
Monday to be the first day of the week, and whether it is represented
by 0 or 1.

Haskell has a better solution: user-defined datatypes.

> data Day = Monday
>          | Tuesday
>          | Wednesday
>          | Thursday
>          | Friday
>          | Saturday
>          | Sunday
>   deriving (Show, Eq)

The new values (`Monday`, `Tuesday`, etc.) are called "constructors" or "data
constructors".  This is a very simple example of a datatype (basically just an
enumeration), but we'll see more examples in a minute.

The last line enables printing and equality for this datatype. We'll
see more about this in the next lecture.




We can define functions on datatypes by pattern matching!  For example:

> nextWeekday :: Day -> Day
> nextWeekday Monday    = Tuesday
> nextWeekday Tuesday   = Wednesday
> nextWeekday Wednesday = Thursday
> nextWeekday Thursday  = Friday
> nextWeekday Friday    = Monday
> nextWeekday Saturday  = Monday
> nextWeekday Sunday    = Monday




This is great.  Now we don't have to worry about the difference
between "Monday" and "monday" or which Int corresponds to which day.
If we make a typo (for example, write Frday instead of Friday), the
compiler will tell us _at compile time_.   If we forget to handle
one of the days in some function, the compiler will warn us about that
too (inexhaustive pattern match warning).

Let's write one more function on `Day`s, to compute when a package
will arrive by "two day shipping":

> twoBusinessDays :: Day -> Day
> twoBusinessDays = undefined





Datatypes can carry data values, too.  For example, here is a datatype
for representing shapes:

> data Shape =
>    Circle    Double Double Double
>  | Rectangle Double Double Double Double

Here, `Circle` and `Rectangle` are the constructors - every `Shape`
value must be one or the other.  Each constructor takes some
arguments:

- A `Circle` is specified by three `Doubles`.  These represent the x
  and y coordinates of the center and the radius.

- A `Rectangle` is specifed by four `Doubles`.  The first two are
  the coordinates of the lower left corner, and the second two are the
  coordinates of the upper right corner.





We can pattern match on shapes.  For example, here is a function that
computes the area of any `Shape`:

> area :: Shape -> Double
> area = undefined







Note that constructors are first-class Haskell values, and
-- like any value -- they have types.

For example the types of `Monday` and `Tuesday` shouldn't surprise you:

        Monday  :: Day
        Tuesday :: Day




The constructors that take arguments have _function_ types.  For
example, you must apply `Circle` to three `Double`s to get a `Shape`:

         Circle    :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Shape

         Rectangle :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Double -> Shape




Recursive Datatypes
===================

Datatypes can be defined recursively.  That is, their constructors can
take other elements of the same type as arguments.

For example, we could define a type representing *nonempty* lists of integers:

> data IntListNE = ISingle Int
>                | ICons Int IntListNE

So that the list `[1,2,3]` is represented as:

> oneTwoThree :: IntListNE
> oneTwoThree = ICons 1 (ICons 2 (ISingle 3))

For comparison with Haskell's built-in lists, it might help to think
of this as:

> oneTwoThree' :: IntListNE
> oneTwoThree' = 1 `ICons` (2 `ICons` ISingle 3)



We can define functions by recursion on `IntListNE`s too, of course:

> sumOfIntListNE :: IntListNE -> Int
> sumOfIntListNE = undefined 

> testSumIL = "sumOfIntListNE" ~: sumOfIntListNE oneTwoThree ~?= 6





Polymorphic Datatypes
=====================

It would sure be annoying to have a seperate kind of list for each
type of data!  Luckily, we know Haskell's list type is polymorphic:
you can have a list of type `[a]` for any `a`.

We can define new polymorphic datatypes too. For example, we can
easily make the non-empty lists above polymorphic.



As another example, here is the definition of the `Maybe` type (from the
Prelude) that we've used in past lectures:

> data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

Notice that the type `Maybe` itself takes an argument: the type
variable `a`.  We're also allowed to use that type variable in the
constructors.  So `Just` is a constructor that can be applied to
values of any type and will create a `Maybe` with the same type:

    Just :: a -> Maybe a

Thus, `Just` and `Nothing` work at any type:

> justThree :: Maybe Int
> justThree = undefined

> noInt :: Maybe Int
> noInt = undefined

> justTrue :: Maybe Bool
> justTrue = undefined







A number of other polymorphic datatypes appear in the standard
library.  For example, here's a datatype that's useful when you
want to carry around values that could have either of two types:

> data Either a b = Left a | Right b

`Either` is often useful for error handling.  Sometimes returning a
`Maybe a` isn't quite good enough because you'd like to give a helpful
error message.  `Either String a` works a little better: you can use
`Left msg` in the case of an error, and `Right v` in case things
are... all right.


For example, here's a safer division function:

> safeDiv :: Int -> Int -> Either String Int
> safeDiv _ 0 = Left "You can't divide by zero, silly."
> safeDiv x y = Right $ x `div` y

Of course, Either is more useful when things can go wrong in more
than one way.







Trees
=====

Now let's play a bit with a bigger example: trees.  Here's one way to
define binary trees that have data at the internal nodes in Haskell:

> data Tree a = Leaf | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Eq, Show)



For example, we can represent the following tree

              5
            /   \
           2     9
          / \     \
         1   4     7

like this:

> exTree :: Tree Int
> exTree = Branch 5 (Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 4 Leaf Leaf))
>                   (Branch 9 Leaf (Branch 7 Leaf Leaf))




We can write simple functions on trees by recursion:

> treePlus :: Tree Int -> Int -> Tree Int
> treePlus = undefined

> testTreePlus = "treePlus" ~: treePlus (Branch 2 Leaf Leaf) 3 ~?= Branch 5 Leaf Leaf




> infixOrder :: Tree a -> [a]
> infixOrder = undefined

> testInfixOrder = "infixOrder" ~: infixOrder exTree ~?= [1,2,4,5,9,7]






But, of course, what we should really do is reimplement our
higher-order patterns for trees!

> treeMap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
> treeMap = undefined





So that, for example, to increment each node in a `Tree Int`, we could
write this:

> treeIncr :: Tree Int -> Tree Int
> treeIncr = treeMap (+1)


> testTreeIncr = "treeIncr" ~: treeIncr (Branch 1 (Branch 2 Leaf Leaf) Leaf) ~?= 
>                                        Branch 2 (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf) Leaf 





The type of `foldr` will have to change a little bit.  Now the
function that tells us how to combine the current element with the
recursive result will have to take two results - one for each branch!

> treeFold = undefined




Now, let's reimplement infixOrder:

> infixOrder' :: Tree a -> [a]
> infixOrder' = undefined

> testInfixOrder' = "infixOrder'" ~: infixOrder' exTree ~?= [1,2,4,5,9,7]



And we can get the other orderings just as quickly!

> prefixOrder :: Tree a -> [a]
> prefixOrder = undefined

> postfixOrder :: Tree a -> [a]
> postfixOrder = undefined


> testPrefixOrder  = "prefixOrder" ~: prefixOrder exTree ~?= [5,2,1,4,9,7]
> testPostfixOrder = "postfixOrder" ~: postfixOrder exTree ~?= [1,4,2,7,9,5]




> main :: IO ()
> main = do 
>   runTestTT $ TestList [
>     testSumIL,
>     testTreePlus,
>     testInfixOrder,
>     testTreeIncr,
>     testInfixOrder',
>     testPrefixOrder,
>     testPostfixOrder ]
>   return ()
